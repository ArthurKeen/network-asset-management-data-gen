```
📋 COPY FOR VISUALIZER: Alert/alert_critical_a1b2c3d4
```

### **🎮 Interactive Pauses**
Strategic pauses let you:
- Open ArangoDB Web Interface
- Navigate to Graph Visualizer
- Paste alert IDs to explore the alert network
- See hasAlert relationships in action
- Observe alert status changes (active → resolved)

### **🎛️ Smart Output Modes**
- **Presentation Mode** (default): Clean, demo-friendly output
- **Verbose Mode** (`--verbose`): Technical details + validation sections

## 🚀 **HOW TO RUN THE REVISED DEMO**

### **Method 1: Via Demo Launcher**
```bash
cd /Users/arthurkeen/code/network-asset-management-demo
PYTHONPATH=/Users/arthurkeen/code/network-asset-management-demo python3 demos/demo_launcher.py

# Select option 1: Automated Walkthrough (Interactive)
# Choose N for presentation mode or Y for verbose mode
```

### **Method 2: Direct Execution**
```bash
cd /Users/arthurkeen/code/network-asset-management-demo
PYTHONPATH=/Users/arthurkeen/code/network-asset-management-demo python3 demos/automated_demo_walkthrough.py --interactive

# Add --verbose for detailed technical output
```

## 📊 **WHAT MAKES THE ALERT DEMO SPECIAL**

### **🔗 Graph Integration**
- Alerts appear as vertices in the graph
- hasAlert edges connect to source devices/software
- Full visualization in ArangoDB Graph Visualizer
- Real-time graph updates as alerts are generated/resolved

### **⏰ TTL Lifecycle Management**
- Active alerts: No TTL (remain indefinitely)
- Resolved alerts: TTL activated (auto-cleanup in 5 minutes for demo)
- Demonstrates production-ready alert aging

### **🎯 Multi-Tenant Isolation**
- Each tenant's alerts completely isolated
- Tenant-specific alert queries and management
- Proper data separation verification

### **🎮 Production-Ready Features**
- Real alert correlation across network topology
- Operational monitoring capabilities
- Alert severity and type classification
- Complete audit trail with timestamps

## 🎉 **DEMO HIGHLIGHTS TO WATCH FOR**
